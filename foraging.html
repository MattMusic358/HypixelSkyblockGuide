    <h1>Foraging Islands</h1>

    <h2>The Forest</h2>
    <p>Here, you get oak wood, and if you stand at the edges of the forest, next to the Graveyard, the zombies will attack you. There is a small hut in the middle of the forest, and there is an NPC selling stuff.</p>

    <h2>The Park</h2>
    <p>Here, you collect every other variation of wood, and fish. You can also get a talisman here by completing the race. Once you complete the Melancholic Viking's Quest, he will open shop for five minutes. He sells The Raiders' Axe, wich is a good mid-game weapons, and other items.</p>
