    <h1>Farming Islands</h1>

    

    <h2>The Farm</h2>
    <p>Here, you can get wheat, wheat and more wheat! First rate wheat! An NPC named Arthur will explain some things about minions if you right-click him. A wheat minion will be on display next to him and you can access and loot it!</p>

    

    <h2>The Barn</h2>
    <p>Here, you can get, other than wheat, melons, pumkins, potatoes, and carrots. Chickens, cows and pigs also spawn here, and you can kill them, although you can't eat their meat.</p>

    

    <h2>The Mushroom Desert</h2>
    <p>Here, you farm sugarcane, cactus, cocoa beans and mushroom. There are sheep and monsters to kill. The sand is unbreakable, but its a great place to fish.</p>
